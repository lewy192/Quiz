# Quiz

This project will contain a multiple choice quiz to test your programming knowledge.

# Introduction

This project was to create a dynamic quiz which would change the question after an answer has been selected. The quiz has a timer and when a user scores wrong 10s is deducted.
If the timer reaches 0, the user is sent directly to submit their score

I chose a different color scheme, for nostalgias sake.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Comments

I decided to personalise my project by using a differenct colorscheme, however the overall program still resembles the mark up required
